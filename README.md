# Readable and adaptable image classification with ResNet

I wrote this code to optimize for readability and adaptability to new experiments. 

Usage tips:
You should use experiment numbers to keep track of what configurations were run. For instance, for your third experiment, you can create a new file `3_train_imagenet.py`. 

Credits to Joseph DiPalma for major edits to the [Deepslide](https://github.com/BMIRDS/deepslide) repository that this code is based on.
