# Readable and adaptable image classification with ResNet

I wrote this code to optimize for readability and adaptability to new experiments. 

## Usage tips 
1. You should use experiment ID to keep track of what configurations were run. For instance, for your third experiment, you can create a new file `3_train_imagenet.py`. You can name your [screen](https://www.tecmint.com/screen-command-examples-to-manage-linux-terminals/)s accordingly with the experiment ID as well.
